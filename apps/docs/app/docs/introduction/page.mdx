# Introduction

<b>Mesh Gradient</b> is a library for creating stunning animated gradient effects. It uses hardware accelerated `WebGL` to render the gradient and is optimized for performance.

## Motivation

In 2021 [@jordienr](https://github.com/jordienr) and [@ndom91](https://github.com/ndom91) has been upload to GitHub gist a [Stripe landing page gradient effect](https://gist.github.com/jordienr/64bcf75f8b08641f205bd6a1a0d4ce1d). Guys has also created a [Whatamesh](https://whatamesh.vercel.app/) website to showcase this beautiful tool.

However, the tool was one large file written in `JavaScript`, had unreadable code and structure, unused event listeners and pretty wierd type definitions.

I decided to rewrite the tool from scratch in `TypeScript` and make it more readable and maintainable.

### Key changes

- ✅ Rewritten the tool from scratch in `TypeScript`
- ✅ Integration with React and SSR
- ✅ New Documentation website with [Playground](./)
- ✅ Simplified API with full type definitions
- ✅ Performance optimizations in core library (resize debounce, pause on out of viewport, remove unused event listeners, size for rendering context keep in sync with canvas size instead of `window` size, etc.)
- ✅ Lot of new features and improvements in core library (randomly generated colors and seeds, smooth appearance, fade transition between 2 gradients out of the box, etc.)
- ✅ Extended configuration for tool

## How to use it?

You can start using `Mesh Gradient` in your project in 2 ways:

import { Cards } from 'nextra/components'
import { SiTypescript, SiReact } from "react-icons/si";

<Cards num={2}>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<SiTypescript />}
    title="Default implementation"
    href="/docs/quick-start"
    arrow
  />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<SiReact />}
    title="React implementation"
    href="/docs/react/quick-start"
    arrow
  />
</Cards>
